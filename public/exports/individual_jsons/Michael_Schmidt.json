With over 25 years of experience as a family practitioner, Dr. Schmidt came to Core Medical Group to implement his unique approach in treating the adverse effects of aging and hormone deficiency. Dr. Schmidt’s career began as an emergency room physician where he soon developed a passion for the treatment of patients suffering from chronic disease. In his treatment of these patients, particularly those with diabetes, Dr. Schmidt took notice of a disturbing trend of severe hormone deficiencies. He discovered that once the hormone imbalance was addressed, the patients made dramatic strides in their recovery. This understanding was the catalyst for his complete dedication to treating those suffering from low levels of hormones essential for the body to perform at optimum levels.
