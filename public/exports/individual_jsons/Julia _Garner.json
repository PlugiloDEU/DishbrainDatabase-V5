I am currently an International Studies Major with a focus in Governance, Diplomacy, and Security at the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies at Indiana University. I am an experienced server/salesperson with a demonstrated history of working in a team and customer service. I have taken the opportunity to learn and advance my skill set through my high school and college experience by receiving the Executive Dean's List in the Spring of 2021 as well as Fall of 2022. I studied abroad in summer 2022 to further my education and to open myself to cultural differences, perspectives, and norms. With this opportunity I have learned how to deal, work, and cope with said variations, which will help me as I continue to grow my professional development as a full-time Business Management Associate at General Mills post graduation.",
