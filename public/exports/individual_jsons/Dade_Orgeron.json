He has worked as a 3D Designer, Art Director, Creative Director, 3D Director and mentor - helping 3D artists hone the skills they need to become masters of their craft. He spent the first part of his career in advertising and title design for film and television working on numerous award winning campaigns for Honda, Microsoft, Autodesk, HBO, Showtime, Verizon, Sprint, NASCAR, Nickelodeon, and more. Early on, his ability to conjure unique and amazingly detailed 3D worlds elevated him as pioneer in the newly developing field of motion graphics and 3D design. \n\nIn 2013, Dade joined TurboSquid to help build and curate the world’s largest 3D content library and to bring 3D models to an even wider audience of non-3D users. Since then, his focus has been to simplify the overtly technical challenges facing 3D artists by developing standards, tools, and training that allow artists to focus more on the creative side of 3D content creation. With a deep understanding of industry trends and tools that are driving 3D processes, he continues to work with many of the biggest names in the 3D space to assure that 3D content adheres to the latest industry requirements and workflows. \n\nNow at Shutterstock, his vision for feeding content to the Metaverse gains even greater focus as he looks toward harnessing AI and ML technologies to help 3D content creators build, conform, manage, and distribute their 3D content. It’s not enough to simply make great looking 3D models, 3D artists need build 3D content that is truly flexible enough to work in all the new and amazing platforms being developed… as well as applications far into the future. Right now is the most amazing time to be in the 3D content creation game, and it’s getting even more exciting every day.",

            "description": "Dade Orgeron has been building virtual worlds for over 25 years. He has worked as a 3D Designer, Art Director, Creative Director, 3D Director and mentor - helping 3D artists hone the skills they need to become masters of their craft. He spent the first part of his career in advertising and title design for film and television working on numerous award winning campaigns for Honda, Microsoft, Autodesk, HBO, Showtime, Verizon, Sprint, NASCAR, Nickelodeon, and more. Early on, his ability to conjure unique and amazingly detailed 3D worlds elevated him as pioneer in the newly developing field of motion graphics and 3D design. \n\nIn 2013, Dade joined TurboSquid to help build and curate the world’s largest 3D content library and to bring 3D models to an even wider audience of non-3D users. Since then, his focus has been to simplify the overtly technical challenges facing 3D artists by developing standards, tools, and training that allow artists to focus more on the creative side of 3D content creation. With a deep understanding of industry trends and tools that are driving 3D processes, he continues to work with many of the biggest names in the 3D space to assure that 3D content adheres to the latest industry requirements and workflows. \n\nNow at Shutterstock, his vision for feeding content to the Metaverse gains even greater focus as he looks toward harnessing AI and ML technologies to help 3D content creators build, conform, manage, and distribute their 3D content. It’s not enough to simply make great looking 3D models, 3D artists need build 3D content that is truly flexible enough to work in all the new and amazing platforms being developed… as well as applications far into the future. Right now is the most amazing time to be in the 3D content creation game, and it’s getting even more exciting every day.",
