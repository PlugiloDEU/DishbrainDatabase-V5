He is funny and profane and gesticulates constantly, putting air quotes around phrases that he merely wants to emphasize. Among this favorite subjects are the New York Jets, which he has vowed to buy, and his own talents, which amaze even him.\n\n“I have as big of an ego as it gets,” he said during a recent interview, in a tone suggesting that he was simply stating the facts, “but I have, stunningly, a lot of humility considering some of the accomplishments I’ve had.”\n\nThese accomplishments include the building of VaynerMedia, which opened in 2009 and now has 290 employees, serving clients as mainstream as Del Monte, General Electric and PepsiCo. They come in the hope that Mr. Vaynerchuk can do for them what he has already done for himself: build an online audience through pluck, ubiquity and charm.\"\n\nRead more here: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/technology/riding-the-hashtag-in-social-media-marketing.html?_r=1",
