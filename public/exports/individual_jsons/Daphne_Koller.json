The drug development process involves multiple steps, each of which involves a complex experiment that often fails. We believe that, for many of these phases, we can develop machine learning models to help predict the outcome of these experiments, and that those models, while inevitably imperfect, will outperform predictions based on traditional heuristics. The key will be to train powerful ML techniques on sufficient amounts of high-quality, relevant data. To achieve this goal, we are building a diverse team that spans multiple disciplines within the life science and machine learning. We bring together cutting edge methods in functional genomics and lab automation to build a bio-data factory that can produce relevant biological data at scale, allowing us to create large, high-quality datasets that enable the development of novel ML models. We're hiring!\n",

But until recently, machine learning has not had the same impact on biomedicine as it's had on so many other challenging domains. The reason for that is twofold: not enough high-quality, relevant data; and not enough \"bilingual\" people who understand both domains and are able to identify the important problems and design the \"right\" solutions. At insitro, we aim to address both these challenges, and help address an important societal problem: design novel, safe, and effective therapies that help more people, faster, and at a lower cost. We have many exciting and challenging problems, and are building a diverse team of exceptionally talented people. Please join us!\n\n",

The drug development process involves multiple steps, each of which involves a complex experiment that often fails. We believe that, for many of these phases, we can develop machine learning models to help predict the outcome of these experiments, and that those models, while inevitably imperfect, will outperform predictions based on traditional heuristics. The key will be to train powerful ML techniques on sufficient amounts of high-quality, relevant data. To achieve this goal, we are building a diverse team that spans multiple disciplines within the life science and machine learning. We bring together cutting edge methods in functional genomics and lab automation to build a bio-data factory that can produce relevant biological data at scale, allowing us to create large, high-quality datasets that enable the development of novel ML models.
