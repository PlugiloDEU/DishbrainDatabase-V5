We are a team of pioneering computer architects, computer scientists, deep learning researchers, and engineers of all types. We have come together to build a new class of computer to accelerate artificial intelligence work by three orders of magnitude beyond the current state of the art. Our flagship product, the CS-3,  is the fastest AI computer in existence. It contains a collection of industry firsts, including the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-3). The WSE-3 is the largest chip ever built. It contains 4 trillion transistors and covers more than 46,225 square millimeters of silicon. The largest competitor's processor is only 80 billion transistors and covers 815 square millimeters. In artificial intelligence work, large chips process information more quickly producing answers in less time. As a result, neural networks that in the past took months to train, can now train in minutes and models that take tens of seconds to serve can be served immediately. \n\nPrior to co-founding Cerebras Systems, I was co-founder and CEO of SeaMicro.  SeaMicro (acquired by AMD for $355 million) was the pioneer in low power server technology. SeaMicro changed the trajectory of the server industry by inventing the high density, lower power, microserver category.\n\nPrior to co-founding SeaMicro, I was Vice President of Marketing and Product Management at Force10 (acquired by Dell for $800 Million) Networks, and Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Corporate Development for Riverstone Networks (NASDAQ: RSTN) from inception through IPO. \n\nMy passion is building teams that solve hard problems. Together we recognize large emerging opportunities, listen closely to customer requirements, build industry transforming products, and then bring these products to market in compelling fashion.",
