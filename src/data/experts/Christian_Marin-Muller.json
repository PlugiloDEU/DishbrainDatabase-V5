At Speratum we combine RNA interference (RNAi) and synthetic biology with a novel, polymeric nanoparticle-based delivery system. Our main focus is  on the treatment of pancreatic and ovarian cancers. We are currently developing novel targeted antiviral applications of our technology. \n\nI have been executive director of Speratum since its foundation in 2014. I have Ph.D. in Molecular Virology and Microbiology from BCM, an MS in Entrepreneurial Biotechnology from the Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Program (STEP) at Case, and a BS in molecular biology from Florida Tech. \n\nI have previously worked as a consultant to biotechnology start-up companies and governmental organizations. My work has contributed to the development of projects ranging from medical devices to HIV research. \n\nI am a founding member of the Scientific Ethics Committee for the Ministry of Health of Costa Rica, founding member of CRBiomed, the biomedical cluster of Costa Rica, and am a member of the Aspen Global Leadership Network (AGLN), the Aspen Institute, and the Central American Leadership Initiative (CALI).
