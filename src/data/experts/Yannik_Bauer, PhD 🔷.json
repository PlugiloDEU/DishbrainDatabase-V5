In my client and internal R&D projects, I build those systems (PoCs, demos, and in production), and give seminars and trainings about prompt engineering for ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and other closed- and open-source models. Starting my life as a Northern German countryside boy from a non-academic background, my journey has taken many improbable paths*. There are still many things Iâ€™d like to do, but if none of them came true, that would also be okay. \n\nSome of my guiding principles:\nâ€¢ life and the universe have no intrinsic goal â€“ what we call purpose or meaningful are the things we value, and that's all that's needed        (to make their pursuit worthwhile and life beautiful)\nâ€¢ people first        (or the ultimate goal should be the flourishing of sentient beings)\nâ€¢ don't treat others like you wouldn't want to be treated (silver rule), treat others like you would like to be treated (golden), treat others like they would like to be treated (diamond)\nâ€¢ freedom, equality, and justice       (everyone should get a fair chance to flourish in their way)\nâ€¢ everything is transient        (and one primary cause for suffering is non-acceptance of this reality through craving and aversion)\nâ€¢ our selves are made up of multiple selves (recognition of this fact allows us to integrate our conflicting parts)\nâ€¢ judge an action by its consequences in context (don't get stuck on principles)\nâ€¢ done is better than perfect        (good enough is better than not done)\n\nMaking the world a better place is a noble but difficult goal. In my view, Effective Altruism (EA) is one of the better ways to care about global priority topics and the long-term future before we run out of time to find infinity.\n\nMy hobbies past and present include fine arts, photography, guitar, reading, juggling, jogging, linguistics, Ultimate Frisbee, swimming, cycling, triathlons, yoga, Lindy Hop dancing, and Vipassana meditation. \n\nIf you are curious or inspired to connect, feel free to reach out and we can explore things together!\n\n*Also including stints as a volunteer for people with special needs in Aberdeen, Scotland, and as a journalist in LomÃ©, Togo.",
