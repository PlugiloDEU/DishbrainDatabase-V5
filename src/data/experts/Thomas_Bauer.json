My next goals were to race through my Bachelors degree proper and apply for investigative positions in the FBI or CIA hoping to find new puzzles to solve. The first half of my plan went swimmingly as I took advantage of new majors focused around the growing threat of cybercrime and its investigation. Alas while the Great Recession had began its recovery swing when I graduated in early 2014 it brought with it a rising tide of underemployed individuals chomping at the bit for their old fields of expertise. I'm sure many of you also experienced this hectic time and drought of opportunities even if you weren't a fresh faced graduate with no career experience. \n\nUndaunted I took a dive into the field of IT self-teaching both the Comptia Network+ and later the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certifications. This would land me my first job as a contractor leased to a high scoring fortune 500 company Cisco Systems, specifically a team devoted to the network management of yet another fortune 500 elite Bank of America. Practicing my newfound network talents was quite the experience but paying my dues at the help desk often resulted in long hours trying to entertain myself or fellow employees through the boredom. Eventually I found a niche aspect in our platform tools that allowed users to execute Visual Basic code to manipulate network devices. Curious I set to learning the language which set off a chain of events from revolutionizing project methodologies, to learning python, to establishing a small unofficial team with my peers, to having our little 3 man group expand to a 15+ organizationally recognized unit considered a \"business critical service\" to well over 100 customer accounts. \n\nLife is certainly full of turns but taking them in stride and being open to the experience grants you a confidence to approach tasks you wouldn't have imagined and I for one look forward to whatever the next turn in my journey is slated my way.",
