I've done a TEDx Talk – Climate change: It’s time to raise our voices and I teach Climate change leadership, an on-line eCornell course. My life experiences include growing up on a one-cow dairy farm, serving in the Marines during the Vietnam War, being a father and someone’s partner for 51 years, and many years in leadership roles at Cornell University. I received my academic degrees from the University Wisconsin, the University of Arizona, and the University of California, Davis.

In this role I helped raise the profile of climate change and how CICSS and Cornell are positioned to respond to this challenge given the depth and breadth of the expertise among the faculty and programs.
