The four years I spent as a boomerang at Salesforce have been some of the most rewarding in my career.  The organization we built, execution speed, and customer and revenue impact of the generative AI platform we developed from prototype to GA product were unmatched. \n\nIt all started in 2022 with 'Gucci GPT'-- an LLM application prototype we developed with Salesforce Research when I was leading Service Cloud, to suggest accurate, on-brand responses to customer service inquiries. We moved at startup speed and rapidly built a prototype that cut support resolution times while increasing NPS and commerce revenue. When ChatGPT captured the world's imagination that November, we were ready with our learnings and shipped 'Einstein GPT for Service and Sales' just a few months later. I was asked to take on a new role to build out an AI platform and organization to support sales, marketing, commerce, and 3p developer use cases beyond Service Cloud. \n\nOur team built the Einstein AI Trust Layer (prompt injection defense, toxicity filters, observability and monitoring), Prompt Builder, Model Builder (to support 3p models including Llama and OpenAI, and finetuning), Advanced RAG, and Agentforce Studio, shipping at incredible speed to get to product-market fit. We had to invent new methods to upskill our 11,000 salespeople and broader ecosystem. We started an applied research incubation team in partnership with Salesforce Research, called Frontier/Atlas, for rapid experimentation that has delivered Generative Canvas UX, LLM Benchmarks for CRM, and Atlas reasoning engine, to ensure an ongoing cadence of organic innovation. The company went through a difficult period in 2022, and these efforts helped re-energize the entire organization and ecosystem.",

The four years I spent as a boomerang at Salesforce have been some of the most rewarding in my career.  The organization we built, execution speed, and customer and revenue impact of the generative AI platform we developed from prototype to GA product were unmatched. \n\nIt all started in 2022 with 'Gucci GPT'-- an LLM application prototype we developed with Salesforce Research when I was leading Service Cloud, to suggest accurate, on-brand responses to customer service inquiries. We moved at startup speed and rapidly built a prototype that cut support resolution times while increasing NPS and commerce revenue. When ChatGPT captured the world's imagination that November, we were ready with our learnings and shipped 'Einstein GPT for Service and Sales' just a few months later. I was asked to take on a new role to build out an AI platform and organization to support sales, marketing, commerce, and 3p developer use cases beyond Service Cloud. \n\nOur team built the Einstein AI Trust Layer (prompt injection defense, toxicity filters, observability and monitoring), Prompt Builder, Model Builder (to support 3p models including Llama and OpenAI, and finetuning), Advanced RAG, and Agentforce Studio, shipping at incredible speed to get to product-market fit. We had to invent new methods to upskill our 11,000 salespeople and broader ecosystem. We started an applied research incubation team in partnership with Salesforce Research, called Frontier/Atlas, for rapid experimentation that has delivered Generative Canvas UX, LLM Benchmarks for CRM, and Atlas reasoning engine, to ensure an ongoing cadence of organic innovation. The company went through a difficult period in 2022, and these efforts helped re-energize the entire organization and ecosystem.",
